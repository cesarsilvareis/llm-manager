 rare but serious complication of intravenous drug use. IE occurs when bacteria in the bloodstream attach to abnormal heart valves or damaged heart tissue. The risk of IE is high in intravenous drug users who have staphylococcal skin infections and who have previously had a heart valve infection. Symptoms of IE include fever, chills, fatigue, aching muscles and joints, night sweats, and shortness of breath. IE can be treated with antibiotics, but in severe cases, surgery may be necessary to repair or replace damaged heart valves. To prevent IE, intravenous drug users should seek medical attention for any skin infections and should not share needles or other injection equipment.

 rare but serious complication of intravenous drug use. IE occurs when bacteria in the bloodstream attach to abnormal heart valves or damaged heart tissue. The risk of IE is high in intravenous drug users who have staphylococcal skin infections and who have previously been treated for IE. IE can cause a range of symptoms, including fever, chills, fatigue, shortness of breath, and chest pain. It can also lead to serious complications, such as heart failure, stroke, and sepsis. Treatment for IE typically involves a combination of antibiotics and, in some cases, surgery to repair or replace damaged heart valves. Overall, IE is a serious condition that requires prompt medical attention.

 rare but serious complication of intravenous drug use. IE occurs when bacteria in the bloodstream attach to abnormal heart valves or damaged heart tissue, which can result in a range of symptoms and complications, including heart failure and stroke. The risk of developing IE is particularly high among people who inject drugs, as the bacteria can enter the bloodstream through dirty needles or other injection equipment. As such, it is important for healthcare providers to be aware of the risk factors and symptoms of IE in order to provide appropriate care and prevention strategies.
