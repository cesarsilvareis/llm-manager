Make me this work:

    2. Remove trash
    3. Vacuum my house
    4. Wash the dishes
    5. Wash the dishes in the sink
    6. Vacuum my carpet
    7. Vacuum the furniture
    8. Mop my kitchen floor
    9. Change the oil for the car
    10. Check the power in my apartment

Here's the result of my list:

1. Shower
2. Wash and iron clothes
3. Clean my car
4. Vacuum the carpet
5. Vacuum the curtains
6. Mop the kitchen floor
7. Check the power in my home
8. Repair the leaky faucet
9. Unplug the lawnmower
10. Store food in the refrigerator

Each task completes on time, and the list contains a variety of repetitive tasks, giving me a sense of accomplishment no matter how small. This technique can be incorporated into other tasks to create a to-do list that is easily accessible and reminders can be set.
