 rare but serious complication of intravenous drug use. IE occurs when bacteria in the bloodstream attach to abnormal heart valves or damaged heart tissue. The risk of IE is high in intravenous drug users who have staphylococcal skin infections. The risk of IE is also high in intravenous drug users who have a history of IE, who have congenital heart disease, or who have a prosthetic heart valve. Symptoms of IE include fever, chills, fatigue, aching muscles and joints, night sweats, and shortness of breath. IE can be diagnosed by blood cultures and echocardiography. IE is treated with antibiotics and, in some cases, surgery to repair or replace damaged heart valves.

 rare but serious complication of intravenous drug use. IE occurs when bacteria in the bloodstream attach to abnormal heart valves or damaged heart tissue. The risk of IE is high in intravenous drug users who have staphylococcal skin infections. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of staphylococcal infections and IE in intravenous drug users admitted to the emergency department (ED). METHODS: This cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted in the ED of a tertiary-referral university teaching hospital in Turkey. All intravenous drug users who were admitted to the ED between 1 November 2013 and 31 October 2014 were included in the study. The demographic characteristics, clinical findings, and laboratory and cardiovascular examination results of the patients were recorded. RESULTS: A total of 115 intravenous drug users were admitted to the ED during the study period. Of these, 10 (8.7%) had staphylococcal infection, and 3 (2.6%) had IE. Two of the three patients with IE had staphylococcal skin infections on admission. The 3 patients with IE were admitted to the ED with non-specific complaints, such as abdominal pain and dyspnoea. CONCLUSION: IE is a rare but serious complication of intravenous drug use. IE occurred in 2.6% of intravenous drug users admitted to the ED in this study. Two of the three patients with IE had staphylococcal skin infections on admission. IE may present with non-specific symptoms, such as abdominal pain and dyspnoea. Therefore, clinicians should consider IE in the differential diagnosis when these symptoms are present in intravenous drug users.

 rare but serious complication of intravenous drug use. IE occurs when bacteria in the bloodstream attach to abnormal heart valves or damaged heart tissue, which can cause a range of complications including heart failure and stroke. IE can be difficult to diagnose and treat, and it can be fatal if left untreated. Therefore, it is important for healthcare providers to be aware of the risk factors and symptoms of IE in order to provide prompt and appropriate care to patients who may be at risk. This course will provide an overview of IE, including its causes, symptoms, and treatment options. It is designed for healthcare providers who may come into contact with patients who are at risk for IE, such as those who work in emergency departments, urgent care clinics, and substance abuse treatment facilities.

 rare but serious complication of intravenous drug use. IE occurs when bacteria in the bloodstream attach to abnormal heart valves or damaged heart tissue, which can result in a range of symptoms and complications. The risk of IE is particularly high among people who inject drugs, as the bacteria can enter the bloodstream through unsterilized injection equipment or through skin abscesses resulting from injection-related injuries. IE can also occur as a result of other underlying medical conditions that increase the risk of bacteria entering the bloodstream, such as untreated gum disease or poorly controlled diabetes. Symptoms of IE can include fever, fatigue, chest pain, shortness of breath, and joint pain. Treatment typically involves a combination of antibiotics and, in some cases, surgery to repair or replace damaged heart valves. Overall, IE is a serious and potentially life-threatening condition that requires prompt medical attention.

 rare but serious complication of intravenous drug use. IE occurs when bacteria in the bloodstream attach to abnormal heart valves or damaged heart tissue, which can result in a range of complications including heart failure and death. This activity will explore the epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of IE among intravenous drug users. Learning Objectives: - Describe the epidemiology of Infective Endocarditis (IE) among intravenous drug users - Explain the pathophysiology of IE and the factors that increase the risk of infection - Identify the clinical manifestations of IE and the diagnostic tests used to confirm the diagnosis - Discuss the treatment options for IE, including antibiotics and surgical interventions - Analyze the challenges associated with managing IE among intravenous drug users, including adherence to treatment and prevention of recurrence.

The risk of IE is particularly high among people who inject drugs, as the bacteria can enter the bloodstream through unsterilized injection equipment. IE can also occur as a result of other conditions that increase the risk of bacteria in the bloodstream, such as dental procedures or urinary tract infections. Symptoms of IE can include fever, fatigue, chills, night sweats, and shortness of breath. Treatment typically involves a combination of antibiotics and, in some cases, surgery to repair or replace damaged heart valves. Prevention measures include proper sterilization of injection equipment, regular dental care, and prompt treatment of infections.

The risk of IE is particularly high among people who inject drugs, as the bacteria can enter the bloodstream through unsterilized injection equipment. However, IE can also occur in people with other risk factors, such as those with congenital heart defects or who have had recent dental or medical procedures. Symptoms of IE can include fever, fatigue, chest pain, and shortness of breath, and treatment typically involves a combination of antibiotics and, in some cases, surgery to repair or replace damaged heart valves. Overall, IE is an important consideration for healthcare providers who work with people who inject drugs or who have other risk factors for this serious condition.

 rare but serious complication of intravenous drug use. IE occurs when bacteria in the bloodstream attach to abnormal heart valves or damaged heart tissue, which can result in a range of symptoms and complications. The risk of IE is particularly high among people who inject drugs, as the bacteria can enter the bloodstream through dirty needles or other injection equipment. However, IE can also occur in people with other risk factors, such as those with certain heart conditions or who have had recent dental or medical procedures. Symptoms of IE may include fever, chills, fatigue, shortness of breath, and swelling in the feet or legs. Treatment typically involves a combination of antibiotics and, in some cases, surgery to repair or replace damaged heart valves. Overall, IE is a serious condition that requires prompt medical attention.

IE occurs when bacteria in the bloodstream attach to abnormal heart valves or damaged heart tissue, which can result in a range of symptoms and complications. The risk of IE is particularly high among people who inject drugs, and the opioid epidemic has led to an increase in IE cases in recent years. This presentation will provide an overview of IE, including its causes, symptoms, and treatment options. It will also highlight the growing problem of IE among people who inject drugs and discuss strategies for prevention and harm reduction.
