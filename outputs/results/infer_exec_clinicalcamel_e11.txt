 ASSISTANT: Infective Endocarditis (IE) is an infection of the heart valves or the lining of the heart chambers. It occurs when bacteria or other microorganisms enter the bloodstream and attach to damaged or abnormal heart valves. Symptoms include fever, fatigue, shortness of breath, chest pain, and unexplained weight loss. Diagnosis is typically made through blood cultures, echocardiography, and other imaging tests. Treatment usually involves a combination of antibiotics and surgery to repair or replace damaged heart valves.
