Infective endocarditis (IE) is an infection of the endocardial surface of the heart. It can be caused by bacteria, fungi, or parasites. The most common cause of IE is bacteria, and the most common bacteria that cause IE are staphylococcus and streptococcus. IE can be classified into native valve endocarditis (NVE), prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE), and cardiac device-related endocarditis (CDRE). NVE is the most common type of IE, accounting for about 70% of all cases. PVE is the second most common type of IE, accounting for about 20% of all cases. CDRE is the least common type of IE, accounting for about 10% of all cases. IE can be classified into acute, subacute, and chronic based on the duration of the infection. Acute IE is the most common type of IE, accounting for about 70% of all cases. Subacute IE is the second most common type of IE, accounting for about 20% of all cases. Chronic IE is the least common type of IE, accounting for about 10% of all cases. IE can be classified into uncomplicated and complicated based on the presence or absence of complications. Uncomplicated IE is the most common type of IE, accounting for about 70% of all cases. Complicated IE is the least common type of IE, accounting for about 10% of all cases. IE can be classified into left-sided and right-sided based on the location of the infection. Left-sided IE is the most common type of IE, accounting for about 70% of all cases. Right-sided IE is the least common type of IE, accounting for about 10% of all cases. IE can be classified into native valve IE (NVE), prosthetic valve IE (PVE), and cardiac device-related IE (CDRE). NVE is the most common type of IE, accounting for about 70% of all cases. PVE is the second most common type of IE, accounting for about 20% of all cases. CDRE is the
