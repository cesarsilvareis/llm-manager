Infective endocarditis (IE) is an infection of the inner lining of the heart (endocardium) and the heart valves, often caused by bacteria that enter the blood during dental or other invasive procedures.
IE can also occur as a complication of congenital or rheumatic heart disease, or as a result of using intravenous drugs.
Signs and symptoms may include fever, chills, headache, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, and fatigue.
Complications can include heart failure, pericarditis, and sepsis.
The risk of death among those infected is about 25%.
Certain dental procedures, such as tooth extractions, can cause bacteria to enter the bloodstream, and can therefore increase the risk of IE.
Other risk factors include intravenous drug use, having an artificial heart valve, congenital heart disease, or a history of IE.
The bacteria most commonly involved are streptococci or staphylococci.
Diagnosis is suspected based on symptoms and suppoed by blood cultures or echocardiogram.
Treatment is generally with intravenous antibiotics.
The number of people affected is about 5 per 100,000 per year.
Rates, however, vary between regions of the world.
Males are affected more often than females.
The risk of death is about 25%.
Without treatment, the risk of death is about 50%.

Infective endocarditis (IE) is an infection of the inner lining of the heart (endocardium) and the heart valves, usually caused by bacteria. IE can develop rapidly over a few days (acute IE) or slowly over a few weeks or possibly months (subacute IE). Signs and symptoms may include: fever, chills, headache, shortness of breath, fatigue, muscle and joint pain, night sweats, and weight loss. IE can be life-threatening if not treated promptly.

Infective endocarditis (IE) is an infection of the inner lining of the heart (endocardium) and the heart valves, usually caused by bacteria. The condition can develop rapidly over a few days (acute infective endocarditis), or slowly over a few weeks or possibly months (subacute infective endocarditis). Many cases of infective endocarditis are caused by bacteria entering the bloodstream through needles, syringes, or other medical devices. However, in some cases, the infection may be caused by bacteria that enters the bloodstream through other means, such as through a skin or gum infection. The symptoms of infective endocarditis can vary from person to person, but may include fever, chills, fatigue, aching muscles and joints, night sweats, and shortness of breath. In some cases, the infection may cause small, painless red or purple spots on the skin, or under the nails or whites of the eyes.

Infective endocarditis (IE) is an infection of the inner lining of the heart, usually the valves. The condition is a rare one, with approximately 5 cases per 100,000 individuals per year. However, it is a potentially fatal condition if left untreated.
The bacteria usually enter the bloodstream through needles, syringes, or other medical devices. People with certain heart conditions, such as congenital heart disease, are at higher risk for IE.
This article will discuss the causes, symptoms, and treatments for IE.

Infective endocarditis (IE) is an infection of the inner lining of the heart (endocardium) and the heart valves, usually caused by bacteria. The condition is a form of endocarditis, which also includes non-infective forms, caused by fungi, parasites, or other microorganisms. IE can develop rapidly over a few days (acute IE), or slowly over a few weeks (subacute IE). Signs and symptoms may include fever, chills, headache, shortness of breath, and abnormal heart sounds.

Infective endocarditis (IE) is an infection of the inner lining of the heart, usually the valves. The condition is a rare one, but it is also very serious. It can develop rapidly and is often fatal if not treated promptly. This article will explain what IE is, its causes, symptoms, treatment options, and prevention strategies.

Infective endocarditis (IE) is an infection of the inner surface of the heart, usually the valves. Osler's nodes ("ephemeral spots of a painful nodular erythema, chiefly in the skin of the hands and feet"), Roth's spots on the retina, positive serum rheumatoid factor Other signs may include night sweats, rigors, anemia, spleen enlargement Damaged valves and endocardium contribute to the development of infective endocarditis. Specifically, the damaged pa of a hea valve forms a local blood clot, a condition known as non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis (NBTE). The platelet and fibrin deposits that form as pa of the blood clotting process allow bacteria to take hold and form vegetations. As previously mentioned, the body has no direct methods of combating valvular vegetations because the valves do not have a dedicated blood supply. This combination of damaged valves, bacterial growth, and lack of a strong immune response results in infective endocarditis. Right-sided IE has been associated with intravenous substance abuse, especially when Staphylococcus aureus is the causative organism. Left-sided IE caused by Staphylococcus aureus can occur in individuals with no underlying hea disease. Community-acquired IE is most often caused by Streptococcus viridans, which normally live in the mouth and throat (Streptococcus mutans, mitis, sanguis or milleri). While S. viridans is the most common group of bacteria that causes IE, Staphylococcus aureus is the most dangerous. S. aureus is the most common cause of nosocomial IE, and it also carries the highest moality rate. Nosocomial, or hospital-acquired, IE is more likely to be caused by highly resistant bacteria. Many different types of bacteria can cause infective endocarditis. Some of the more common ones are: *Staphyloc

Infective endocarditis (IE) is an infection of the inner lining of the heart, usually the valves. The condition is a rare one, but it is also very serious. It can develop rapidly and is often fatal if not treated promptly. IE can be caused by bacteria, fungi, or other microorganisms that enter the bloodstream and attach to abnormal heart valves or other areas of the heart. People with certain heart conditions, such as congenital heart disease, are at higher risk for developing IE. Other risk factors include intravenous drug use, untreated dental infections, and recent surgery. Symptoms of IE may include fever, chills, fatigue, aching joints and muscles, night sweats, and shortness of breath. Treatment typically involves a combination of antibiotics and, in some cases, surgery to repair or replace damaged heart valves.
