 rare but serious complication of intravenous drug use. IE occurs when bacteria in the bloodstream attach to abnormal heart valves or damaged heart tissue, which can result in a range of complications including heart failure, stroke, and sepsis. IE can be difficult to diagnose and treat, and it can have serious consequences if left untreated. This presentation will review the epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of IE in the context of intravenous drug use.

This presentation will review the epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of IE in the context of intravenous drug use. Learning objectives: At the end of this session, participants will be able to: 1. Understand the epidemiology of Infective Endocarditis (IE) among people who inject drugs; 2. Describe the pathophysiology of IE; 3. Identify the clinical signs and symptoms of IE; 4. Understand the diagnostic approach to IE; 5. Understand the treatment options for IE.

 rare but serious complication of intravenous drug use. IE occurs when bacteria in the bloodstream attach to abnormal heart valves or damaged heart tissue, which can result in a range of complications including heart failure, stroke, and sepsis. The risk of IE is particularly high among people who inject drugs, as the bacteria can enter the bloodstream through unsterilized injection equipment or skin that has been contaminated with bacteria. IE can be difficult to diagnose, as symptoms may be nonspecific or absent in the early stages of the infection. Treatment typically involves a combination of antibiotics and, in some cases, surgical intervention to repair or replace damaged heart valves. Prevention strategies include harm reduction measures such as needle exchange programs and education about the risks of IE and how to prevent it.

 rare but serious complication of intravenous drug use. IE occurs when bacteria in the bloodstream attach to abnormal heart valves or damaged heart tissue. The resulting infection can lead to serious complications, such as heart failure and sepsis. IE is a preventable disease, and healthcare providers should be aware of the risk factors and symptoms to identify and treat it promptly. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of infective endocarditis in intravenous drug users.

 rare but serious complication of intravenous drug use. IE occurs when bacteria in the bloodstream attach to abnormal heart valves or damaged heart tissue, which can result in a range of cardiac and non-cardiac complications. The risk of IE is elevated among people who inject drugs (PWID), particularly those who are HIV-positive. This presentation will review the epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of IE among PWID. Learning objectives: 1. Understand the epidemiology of IE among PWID. 2. Describe the pathophysiology of IE. 3. Identify the clinical manifestations of IE. 4. Understand the diagnostic approach to IE. 5. Understand the treatment options for IE.

To reduce the risk of IE, people who inject drugs should practice safe injection techniques, such as using clean needles and avoiding sharing injection equipment. Additionally, healthcare providers should screen people who inject drugs for IE risk factors and provide education on how to reduce the risk of infection.
