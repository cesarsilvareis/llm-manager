As a biomedical expert, my answer would be: Infective Endocarditis is an inflammatory condition that affects the inner lining of the heart, specifically the heart valves. It is caused by a bacterial infection that enters the bloodstream and attaches to the heart valves, where it can cause damage and inflammation. The symptoms of Infective Endocarditis can include fever, chills, fatigue, and heart murmur. It is a serious condition that requires prompt medical attention, as it can lead to complications such as heart failure, stroke, and sepsis.

The condition can develop rapidly and can be life-threatening if not treated promptly. IE is more common in people with certain heart conditions, such as damaged or artificial valves, but it can also occur in people with healthy hearts. Symptoms may include fever, chills, fatigue, aching joints and muscles, night sweats, and shortness of breath. Treatment typically involves a combination of antibiotics and, in some cases, surgery to repair or replace damaged heart valves.
