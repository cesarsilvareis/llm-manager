Infective Endocarditis (IE) is an infection of the inner lining of the heart (endocardium) and heart valves, often caused by bacteria entering the bloodstream through injection drug use or other means. IE can cause a range of symptoms, including fever, fatigue, and heart murmur, and can lead to serious complications such as heart failure, stroke, and sepsis.

Infective Endocarditis (IE) is an infection of the inner lining of the heart, usually the valves, that is most commonly caused by bacteria entering the bloodstream through injection drug use or other means. The bacteria attach to damaged heart valves and form clumps called vegetations, which can cause a range of symptoms such as fever, fatigue, and heart murmur. If left untreated, IE can lead to serious complications such as heart failure, stroke, and even death.
