## Answer
Infective endocarditis (IE) is an infection of the endocardial surface of the heart. It can be caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, or parasites. The most common cause is bacteria, and the most common bacteria are staphylococci, streptococci, and enterococci. IE can be classified as native valve endocarditis (NVE), prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE), or cardiac device-related endocarditis (CDRE). NVE is the most common type of IE, accounting for approximately 70% of cases. PVE is the second most common type of IE, accounting for approximately 20% of cases. CDRE is the least common type of IE, accounting for approximately 10% of cases. IE can be classified as acute, subacute, or chronic. Acute IE is the most common type of IE, accounting for approximately 70% of cases. Subacute IE is the second most common type of IE, accounting for approximately 20% of cases. Chronic IE is the least common type of IE, accounting for approximately 10% of cases. IE can be classified as uncomplicated or complicated. Uncomplicated IE is the most common type of IE, accounting for approximately 70% of cases. Complicated IE is the least common type of IE, accounting for approximately 10% of cases. IE can be classified as left-sided or right-sided. Left-sided IE is the most common type of IE, accounting for approximately 70% of cases. Right-sided IE is the least common type of IE, accounting for approximately 10% of cases. IE can be classified as native valve IE or prosthetic valve IE. Native valve IE is the most common type of IE, accounting for approximately 70% of cases. Prosthetic valve IE is the least common type of IE, accounting for approximately 10% of cases. IE can be classified as culture-positive or culture-negative. Culture-positive IE is the most common type of IE, accounting for approximately 70% of cases. Culture-negative IE is the least
