1. an inflammatory disease of endocardium which lines the surface of cardiac valves and lining of blood vessels, caused by microbial infection;
2. a microbial infection of the heart’s inner lining that can damage the heart valves, leading to heart failure and death if untreated.

The term “endocarditis” refers to the inflammation of the inner layer of the heart, i.e., the endocardium. The terms “infective endocarditis” and “bacterial endocarditis” are used interchangeably, although bacteria are not the only pathogens causing this disease.

Infective endocarditis (IE) is an inflammatory disease of endocardium which lines the surface of cardiac valves and lining of blood vessels, caused by microbial infection. Microbial infection of the endocardium can lead to the formation of vegetations composed of thrombotic debris and organisms, mainly bacteria, adhering to the damaged heart valve. These vegetations can cause damage to the valve or rupture one of the chordae tendineae, leading to regurgitation of blood. If untreated, this condition can lead to heart failure and death.

The clinical presentation of IE is variable and non-specific, making it difficult to diagnose. Symptoms may include fever, chills, fatigue, malaise, night sweats, and weight loss. Other symptoms may include shortness of breath, cough, chest pain, abdominal pain, and joint pain. Complications of IE can be embolic, with septic emboli occurring most commonly in the brain, kidneys, spleen, and extremities.

Diagnosis of IE requires a combination of clinical suspicion, blood cultures, echocardiography, and histopathological examination of vegetations or infected tissue. Antimicrobial therapy is the mainstay of treatment for IE, with surgery required in some cases to repair or replace damaged heart valves.

In summary, Infective Endocarditis is a serious microbial infection of the heart’s inner lining that can damage the heart
