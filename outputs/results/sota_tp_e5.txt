 Infective Endocarditis (IE) is a microbial infection of the heart's inner lining, usually involving the heart valves. IE is caused by bacteria, fungi, or other microorganisms that enter the bloodstream and attach to damaged heart valves or other cardiac abnormalities. Symptoms include fever, fatigue, and heart murmur. Treatment typically involves a combination of antibiotics and, in severe cases, surgery to repair or replace damaged valves. Prevention includes proper dental hygiene and antibiotic prophylaxis before certain dental or medical procedures.

 Infective Endocarditis (IE) is an inflammatory disease affecting the inner lining of heart valves and mural endocardium. It results from the interaction between a susceptible host, an infective agent, and a favorable environment. The etiology comprises bacterial, fungal, and other microbial infections. IE presents with symptoms such as fever, fatigue, and heart murmur. Diagnosis relies on clinical signs, blood cultures, and echocardiography. Treatment includes antimicrobial therapy and, in severe cases, surgical intervention. Complications encompass metastatic infections and valve dysfunction. Prophylaxis and prognosis depend on the early diagnosis and adequate treatment.

 Infective Endocarditis (IE) is an inflammatory disease affecting the inner lining of heart valves and mural endocardium. It results from the interaction between a susceptible host, an infective agent, and a favorable environment. The etiology is mainly due to bacterial infection, with Staphylococcus aureus being the most common causative organism. Transesophageal echocardiography is a key diagnostic tool, while antibiotic therapy and, occasionally, surgical intervention constitute the main treatment options. Complications include valvular dysfunction, metastatic infections, and perivalvular abscesses.
