Infective endocarditis is an infection of the inner surface of the heart, usually the valves. Osler's nodes ("ephemeral spots of a painful nodular erythema, chiefly in the skin of the hands and feet"), Roth's spots on the retina, positive serum rheumatoid factor Other signs may include night sweats, rigors, anemia, spleen enlargement Damaged valves and endocardium contribute to the development of infective endocarditis. Specifically, the damaged pa of a hea valve forms a local blood clot, a condition known as non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis (NBTE). The platelet and fibrin deposits that form as pa of the blood clotting process allow bacteria to take hold and form vegetations. As previously mentioned, the body has no direct methods of combating valvular vegetations because the valves do not have a dedicated blood supply. This combination of damaged valves, bacterial growth, and lack of a strong immune response results in infective endocarditis. Damage to the valves and endocardium can be caused by: Altered, turbulent blood flow. The areas that fibrose, clot, or roughen as a result of this altered flow are known as jet lesions. Altered blood flow is more likely in high pressure areas, so ventricular septal defects or patent ductus aeriosus can create more susceptibility to infective endocarditis than atrial septal defects. Catheters, electrodes, and other intracardiac prosthetic devices. Solid paicles from repeated intravenous injections. Chronic inflammation. Examples include auto-immune mechanisms, degenerative valvular lesions, and previous valvular site infections. The risk factors for infective endocarditis provide a more extensive list of conditions that can damage the hea. The pathogenesis of infective endocarditis can be broken down into three sequential steps: Initial adherence of the microorganism to the damaged hea valve. This adherence is mediated by the expression of specific receptors on the surface of the microorganism that are attracted

Infective endocarditis (IE) is an infection of the inner lining of the heart (the endocardium).
The condition is a form of endocarditis, which is an inflammation of the endocardium. However, the term “endocarditis” is usually used to refer to infective endocarditis.
Infective endocarditis can be acute or subacute. Acute infective endocarditis develops rapidly, with symptoms appearing within days or even hours of the infection. Subacute infective endocarditis develops more slowly, and symptoms may not appear for weeks or even months.
Infective endocarditis can also be classified as either native valve endocarditis or prosthetic valve endocarditis, depending on the type of heart valve affected. Native valve endocarditis occurs in heart valves that have not been replaced or repaired. Prosthetic valve endocarditis occurs in people who have had their heart valves replaced or repaired.
Infective endocarditis can be a serious and potentially fatal condition. It is important to seek medical attention immediately if you suspect that you or someone you know may have IE.
What Causes Infective Endocarditis?
Infective endocarditis is caused by bacteria in the bloodstream multiplying and spreading across the inner lining of the heart.
There are many different types of bacteria that can cause IE. Some of the most common include:
Staphylococcus aureus (S aureus)
Streptococcus gallolyticus (S gallolyticus)
Streptococcus gordonii (S gordonii)
Neisseria meningitidis (N meningitidis)
Haemophilus influenzae (H influenzae)
Fusobacterium nucleatum (F nucleatum)
Prevotella oralis (P oralis)
Prevotella melaninogenica (P melaninogenica)

Subacute endocarditis refers to infections that occur over a period of weeks to months and are usually due to organisms of low virulence. This type of endocarditis is insidious in onset, with minimal or no signs of acute inflammation. The clinical course is usually more benign than that of acute endocarditis, but the disease often is not diagnosed until late in its course, when cardiac damage has already occurred.
Subacute endocarditis can be caused by chewing or inhaling contaminated vegetables, or from using contaminated needles or syringes. It can also be caused by bacteria entering the bloodstream during dental procedures, or from an infection elsewhere in the body.
Symptoms of subacute endocarditis may include fever, fatigue, muscle aches, shortness of breath, and chest pain. The condition may also cause heart murmur, which is an abnormal sound heard during a heartbeat.
Treatment for subacute endocarditis typically involves antibiotics to clear the infection, as well as medications to manage symptoms and prevent complications. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to repair damaged heart valves or remove infected tissue.
Prevention of subacute endocarditis involves proper hygiene and infection control practices, such as washing hands thoroughly and using sterile equipment. People at high risk for developing endocarditis, such as those with certain heart conditions, may be advised to take antibiotics before certain medical procedures to prevent infection.
