 severe disease with high morbidity and mortality. The diagnosis of IE is based on the modified Duke criteria, which include clinical, microbiological, and echocardiographic findings. The aim of this study was to assess the knowledge of medical students about IE. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 102 medical students from the University of Medicine and Pharmacy "Victor Babes" Timisoara, Romania. The questionnaire included questions regarding demographics, risk factors for IE, diagnostic methods, and treatment options. Results: Most participants were female (64.7%), aged between 23 and 25 years old (89.2%). Only 37.3% of the respondents had heard about IE before. The most common source of information was the internet (40.2%) followed by university courses (37.3%). The majority of the students knew that IE can be caused by bacterial infections (90.2%) and that it can affect heart valves (87.3%). However, only 43.1% of the students were aware that IE can also affect other structures such as the myocardium or endocardium. Regarding diagnostic methods, 87.3% of the students correctly identified blood cultures as an important tool for diagnosing IE. However, only 43.1% of the students were aware that transesophageal echocardiography is more sensitive than transthoracic echocardiography for detecting vegetations. When asked about treatment options, 87.3% of the students correctly identified antibiotics as the mainstay of therapy. Conclusions: Our study highlights the need for improved education on IE among medical students. By increasing awareness and understanding of this condition, we can improve early detection and management, ultimately reducing the burden of IE.

# Introduction
Infective endocarditis (IE) is a severe disease characterized by inflammation of the endocardium, usually involving one or more heart valves. It is caused by various pathogens, including bacteria, fungi, viruses, and parasites. The incidence of IE has been steadily increasing over the past few decades due to adv
