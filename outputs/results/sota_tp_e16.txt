 rare but serious complication of intravenous drug use. IE occurs when bacteria in the bloodstream attach to abnormal heart valves or damaged heart tissue. The bacteria can enter the bloodstream through needles, syringes, or other injection equipment that has been contaminated with bacteria. IE can cause a range of symptoms, including fever, chills, fatigue, and shortness of breath. It can also cause complications such as heart failure, stroke, and sepsis, which can be life-threatening. To prevent IE, people who inject drugs should use clean needles and syringes each time they inject, and avoid sharing injection equipment with others. It is also important to seek medical attention promptly if any symptoms of IE are present.

 rare but serious complication of intravenous drug use. IE occurs when bacteria in the bloodstream attach to abnormal heart valves or damaged heart tissue. The risk of IE is high in intravenous drug users who have staphylococcal skin infections and those with a history of IE. IE can cause serious complications such as heart failure, brain abscess, and sepsis. Treatment for IE typically involves a combination of antibiotics and, in some cases, surgery to repair or replace damaged heart valves.

 rare but serious complication of intravenous drug use. IE occurs when bacteria in the bloodstream attach to abnormal heart valves or damaged heart tissue, which can result in a range of symptoms and complications. The risk of IE is particularly high among people who inject drugs, as the bacteria can enter the bloodstream through unsterilized injection equipment. IE can also occur as a result of other underlying medical conditions that affect the heart, such as congenital heart defects or previous heart surgery. Symptoms of IE can include fever, fatigue, chest pain, and shortness of breath. Treatment typically involves a combination of antibiotics and, in some cases, surgery to repair or replace damaged heart valves. Overall, IE is a serious and potentially life-threatening condition that requires prompt medical attention.

The risk of IE is high in intravenous drug users who have staphylococcal skin infections and those with a history of IE. Other risk factors include having a central venous catheter or another intravenous device, such as a prosthetic heart valve. Symptoms of IE include fever, chills, fatigue, aching muscles and joints, night sweats, and shortness of breath. IE can be diagnosed through blood cultures and echocardiography. Treatment usually involves a prolonged course of intravenous antibiotics and, in some cases, surgery to repair or replace damaged heart valves.
