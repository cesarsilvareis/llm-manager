Infective endocarditis (IE) is an infection of the inner lining of the heart chambers and valves. It occurs when bacteria or other microorganisms enter the bloodstream and attach to damaged areas in the heart. Symptoms may include fever, fatigue, shortness of breath, chest pain, and unexplained weight loss. Diagnosis is typically made through blood cultures, echocardiography, and other imaging tests. Treatment usually involves a course of antibiotics, and in severe cases, surgery may be necessary.
