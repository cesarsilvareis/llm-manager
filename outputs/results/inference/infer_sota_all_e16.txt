 life-threatening disease with high morbidity and mortality. The diagnosis of IE is based on the modified Duke criteria, which include clinical, microbiological, and echocardiographic findings. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is the first-line imaging modality for the diagnosis of IE. However, transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is more sensitive than TTE for the detection of vegetations, especially in patients with prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE) and cardiac implantable electronic device (CIED) endocarditis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic value of TTE and TEE in patients with suspected IE. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted on patients with suspected IE who were referred to the echocardiography laboratory of Rajaie Cardiovascular Medical and Research Center, Tehran, Iran, from 2016 to 2018. All patients underwent TTE and TEE. The results of TTE and TEE were compared with the final
