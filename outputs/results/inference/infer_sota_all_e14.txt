 life-threatening disease with high morbidity and mortality. The diagnosis of IE is based on the modified Duke criteria, which include clinical, microbiological, and echocardiographic findings. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is the gold standard imaging modality for the diagnosis of IE. However, TEE is invasive, expensive, and not widely available. Therefore, there is a need for a non-invasive, inexpensive, and widely available imaging modality for the diagnosis of IE. The aim of this study was to assess the diagnostic accuracy of cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) for the diagnosis of IE. Methods: This was a single-center, retrospective study of patients with suspected IE who underwent CMR and TEE. The primary outcome was the diagnostic accuracy of CMR for the diagnosis of IE. Secondary outcomes included the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of CMR for the diagnosis of IE. Results: A total of 100 patients were included in
