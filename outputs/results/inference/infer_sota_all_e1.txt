Infective endocarditis (IE) is an infection of the endocardial surface of the heart. It can be caused by bacteria, fungi, or parasites. The most common cause of IE is bacteria, which accounts for 95% of cases. The most common bacteria that cause IE are Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus viridans, and Enterococcus faecalis. IE is a rare disease, with an incidence of 3-10 cases per 100,000 people per year. The incidence of IE has been increasing over the past few decades, likely due to an increase in the number of patients with underlying cardiac conditions, such as valvular heart disease, congenital heart disease, and prosthetic heart valves. IE can be classified into native valve IE (NVE) and prosthetic valve IE (PVE). NVE is the most common type of IE, accounting for 60-70% of cases. PVE is less common, accounting for 20-30% of cases. IE can also be classified into acute and subacute IE. Acute IE is defined as IE that occurs within 4 weeks of the onset of symptoms. Subacute IE is defined as IE that occurs between 4 and 12 weeks of the onset of symptoms. IE can also be classified into left-sided IE and right-sided IE. Left-sided IE is the most common type of IE, accounting for 70-80% of cases. Right-sided IE is less common, accounting for 20-30% of cases. IE can also be classified into culture-positive IE and culture-negative IE. Culture-positive IE is the most common type of IE, accounting for 70-80% of cases. Culture-negative IE is less common, accounting for 20-30% of cases. IE can also be classified into definite IE, possible IE, and rejected IE. Definite IE is the most common type of IE, accounting for 70-80% of cases. Possible IE is less common, accounting for 20-30% of cases. Rejected IE is
