 life-threatening disease with high morbidity and mortality. It is caused by bacterial infection of the endocardial surface of the heart. The diagnosis of IE is based on clinical, microbiological, and echocardiographic findings. Echocardiography plays a crucial role in the diagnosis and management of IE. The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) in the diagnosis of IE. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted on patients with suspected IE who were referred to the echocardiography laboratory of Imam Reza Hospital, Mashhad, Iran, from 2016 to 2018. All patients underwent TTE and TEE. The results of echocardiography were compared with the final diagnosis of IE based on the modified Duke criteria. Results: A total of 100 patients were included in the study. The mean age of the patients was 53.7 Â± 17.
