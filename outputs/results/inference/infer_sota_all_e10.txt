Infective endocarditis (IE) is an infection of the endocardial surface of the heart, which may involve one or more heart valves, the mural endocardium, or a septal defect. It is characterized by the presence of vegetations on the valve leaflets or other endocardial surfaces. IE can be caused by a variety of microorganisms, including bacteria, fungi, and viruses. The most common causative agents are Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus viridans, and Enterococcus faecalis.

The diagnosis of IE is based on clinical findings, laboratory tests, and imaging studies. The Duke criteria are commonly used to establish the diagnosis. These criteria include the presence of two major criteria, one major and three minor criteria, or five minor criteria. The major criteria include the presence of vegetations on echocardiography, positive blood cultures, and new regurgitant murmur. The minor criteria include fever, vascular phenomena, immunologic phenomena, and microbiologic evidence of infection.
