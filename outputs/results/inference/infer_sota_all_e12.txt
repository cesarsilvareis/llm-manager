Infective endocarditis (IE) is an infection of the heart valves or endocardium, the inner lining of the heart chambers. It is caused by bacteria that enter the bloodstream and settle in the heart, where they multiply and cause damage to the heart valves. IE is a serious condition that can lead to heart failure, stroke, and even death if left untreated.

## Symptoms of Infective Endocarditis
The symptoms of IE can vary depending on the severity of the infection and the location of the infection in the heart. Common symptoms include fever, chills, night sweats, fatigue, shortness of breath, and chest pain. Some patients may also experience joint pain, muscle aches, and skin rashes.

## Diagnosis of Infective Endocarditis
Diagnosing IE can be challenging, as the symptoms are often non-specific and can mimic other conditions. The diagnosis is typically made based on a combination of clinical symptoms, laboratory tests, and imaging studies. Blood cultures are the gold standard
