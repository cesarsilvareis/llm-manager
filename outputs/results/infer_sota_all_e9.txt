 ASSISTANT: Infective Endocarditis (IE) is an infection of the heart valves or the lining of the heart chambers. It occurs when bacteria or other microorganisms enter the bloodstream and attach to damaged or abnormal heart valves. Symptoms include fever, fatigue, shortness of breath, chest pain, and unexplained weight loss. Diagnosis is typically made through blood cultures, echocardiography, and other imaging tests. Treatment involves antibiotics and, in severe cases, surgery to repair or replace damaged valves. Prevention includes good oral hygiene, avoiding intravenous drug use, and prompt treatment of skin infections.
