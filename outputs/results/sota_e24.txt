Result:
Infective Endocarditis is an inflammatory disease caused by bacterial infection on the inner lining of the heart (endocardium) and heart valves. It can lead to serious complications such as heart failure, stroke, and sepsis. The disease is more common in individuals with pre-existing heart conditions, but can also occur in healthy individuals. Treatment typically involves a combination of antibiotics and, in some cases, surgery to repair or replace damaged heart valves.
