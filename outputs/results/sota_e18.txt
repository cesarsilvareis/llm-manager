 rare but serious complication of intravenous drug use. IE occurs when bacteria in the bloodstream attach to abnormal heart valves or damaged heart tissue, which can result in a range of complications including heart failure, stroke, and sepsis. IE can be difficult to diagnose and treat, and it can have serious consequences if left untreated. This presentation will review the epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of IE in the context of intravenous drug use.

IE can be difficult to diagnose and treat, and it can have serious consequences if left untreated. This presentation will provide an overview of IE, including its causes, symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment options. The goal is to increase awareness of this potentially life-threatening condition and improve the ability of healthcare providers to identify and treat it.

 rare but serious complication of intravenous drug use. IE occurs when bacteria in the bloodstream attach to abnormal heart valves or damaged heart tissue, which can result in a range of complications including sepsis and death. The risk of IE is particularly high among people who inject drugs (PWID), with rates of IE among PWID estimated to be 10-20 times higher than in the general population. Despite these alarming statistics, there is limited data available on the prevalence and risk factors for IE among PWID in Vancouver, Canada. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the prevalence and risk factors for IE among PWID in Vancouver.

 rare but serious complication of intravenous drug use. IE occurs when bacteria in the bloodstream attach to abnormal heart valves or damaged heart tissue, which can result in a range of complications including heart failure, stroke, and sepsis. The risk of IE is particularly high among people who inject drugs, as the bacteria can enter the bloodstream through unsterilized injection equipment or skin that has been contaminated with bacteria. IE can also occur as a result of other conditions that increase the risk of bacteria in the bloodstream, such as dental procedures or urinary tract infections. Symptoms of IE can include fever, chills, fatigue, shortness of breath, and joint pain. Treatment typically involves a combination of antibiotics and, in some cases, surgery to repair or replace damaged heart valves. Prevention strategies include the use of sterile injection equipment, proper wound care, and prompt treatment of infections.

 rare but serious complication of intravenous drug use. We describe here a case of IE in a young adult who recently began using intravenous drugs during the COVID-1s pandemic. Case Report: A 23-year-old man with no significant past medical history presented to the emergency department with a one-week history of fevers and chills. Physical exam revealed a new systolic murmur and sternal tenderness. Blood cultures were positive for Enterococcus faecalis. Echocardiogram revealed a large vegetation on the mitral valve as well as moderate mitral regurgitation. The patient was admitted to the hospital and underwent successful surgical excision of the vegetation and repair of the mitral valve. He made a full recovery and was discharged home on IV antibiotics concluding a four-week course as an outpatient. Conclusion: This case illustrates the devastating consequences of intravenous drug use. The patient developed a life-threatening complication of endocarditis within weeks of beginning to use intravenous drugs. Further, this case highlights the challenges of caring for patients with substance use disorder during the COVID-19 pandemic.

IE can be difficult to diagnose and treat, and it can lead to serious complications such as heart failure or sepsis. To prevent IE, people who inject drugs should avoid sharing needles or other injection equipment, and should seek medical attention if they develop symptoms of IE.

 rare but serious complication of intravenous drug use. IE occurs when bacteria in the bloodstream attach to abnormal heart valves or damaged heart tissue, which can cause a range of symptoms and lead to serious complications such as heart failure and stroke. The risk of IE is particularly high among people who inject drugs, as the bacteria can enter the bloodstream through dirty needles or other injection equipment. As such, it is important for clinicians to be aware of the risk factors and symptoms of IE in order to provide appropriate care and prevent serious complications.
