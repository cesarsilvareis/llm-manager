a.k.a. infective endocarditis (IE). It is an inflammatory condition of the inner lining of the heart, usually the valves, caused by an infectious agent. IE can also occur on artificial valves, in the prosthetic material itself or in the tissue surrounding it.

The main causes of IE are bacteria, particularly Staphylococcus aureus, which enter the bloodstream and attach to damaged heart valves or prosthetics. Other predisposing factors include intravenous drug use, untreated dental infections, and urinary tract infections.

Symptoms of IE include fever, chills, fatigue, aching joints and muscles, night sweats, and shortness of breath. IE can lead to life-threatening complications such as heart failure, stroke, and sepsis if not treated promptly.

Diagnosis of IE requires a combination of clinical suspicion, blood cultures, and echocardiography. Treatment typically involves prolonged antibiotic therapy and, in some cases, surgical intervention to repair or replace damaged heart valves.

Preventative measures include antibiotic prophylaxis before certain dental or medical procedures, good oral hygiene, and timely treatment of infections.
