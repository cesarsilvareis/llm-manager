Infective Endocarditis is an infection of the inner lining of the heart, usually the valves, that is caused by bacteria in the bloodstream. It can cause fever, chills, fatigue, and heart murmur. It is a serious condition that can lead to complications such as heart failure, stroke, and sepsis. Treatment typically involves a combination of antibiotics and, in some cases, surgery to repair or replace damaged heart valves.

Infective Endocarditis is an infection of the inner lining of the heart, usually the valves, that is caused by bacteria or other microorganisms. It can develop when bacteria enters the bloodstream and attaches to damaged heart valves or other areas of the heart. The infection can cause symptoms such as fever, chills, fatigue, and shortness of breath, and can lead to serious complications if not treated promptly. Treatment typically involves a combination of antibiotics and, in some cases, surgery to repair or replace damaged heart valves.
