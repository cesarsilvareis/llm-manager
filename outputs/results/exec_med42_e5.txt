a complex disease caused by a variety of microorganisms that colonize the heart valves, leading to the formation of friable vegetations which can cause severe complications such as embolism and sepsis. It's typically seen in patients with preexisting valvular lesions or prosthetic valves, but can also occur in healthy individuals. Diagnosis relies on the Duke Criteria, which involves a combination of clinical signs, echocardiographic findings, and laboratory results. Treatment depends on the causative organism and usually involves prolonged courses of intravenous antibiotics, sometimes followed by surgery. Prophylactic measures include antibiotic administration prior to certain dental/medical procedures, as well as good oral hygiene practices.
