Infective endocarditis (IE) is an infection of the inner lining of the heart chambers and valves, or the blood vessels that lead to or from the heart. It can develop rapidly over a few days or slowly over a few weeks. Signs and symptoms may include fever, chills, headache, shortness of breath, and abnormal heart sounds.
IE can be caused by bacteria, fungi, or other microorganisms that enter the bloodstream and infect the heart. People with certain heart conditions, such as damaged or artificial valves, are at higher risk for IE.
Treatment typically involves a combination of antibiotics and, in some cases, surgery to repair or replace damaged heart valves. Without prompt treatment, IE can be life-threatening.

Infective endocarditis (IE) is an infection of the inner lining of the heart chambers and valves, or the blood vessels that lead to or from the heart. The term “endocarditis” refers to the inner lining of the heart; “infective” refers to the presence of an infection.
Infective endocarditis is caused by bacteria in the bloodstream multiplying and spreading across the inner lining of the heart. The infection can damage the heart valves, causing them to become leaky or narrowed. The damaged valves can change the normal flow of blood through the heart, causing blood to flow backward or in the wrong direction.
Infective endocarditis can be acute (rapid onset) or subacute (slow onset). Acute infective endocarditis develops quickly, and its symptoms are obvious. Subacute infective endocarditis develops slowly, and its symptoms are less obvious.
Infective endocarditis can be life threatening if not treated promptly.

Infective endocarditis (IE) is an infection of the inner lining of the heart chambers and valves, or the blood vessels that lead to or from the heart. The term “endocarditis” refers to the inner lining of the heart; “infective” refers to the presence of an infection.
IE can develop quickly or slowly; it depends on what type of germ is causing it and whether the person has an underlying heart problem. When IE develops quickly, it’s called acute infective endocarditis. When it develops slowly, it’s called subacute infective endocarditis.
Overall, IE is a rare condition that affects both children and adults. It’s more common in men than women. The risk of IE increases with age.
Infective Endocarditis Causes
IE occurs if bacteria, fungi, or other germs invade your bloodstream and attach to abnormal areas of your heart. The infection can develop quickly or slowly, depending on what type of germ is causing it and whether you have an underlying heart problem.
Major Causes of Infective Endocarditis
The germs that cause IE often come from the gums, teeth, skin, or intestinal tract. These germs can enter your bloodstream through needles, syringes, or other medical devices.
Some factors make it easier for germs to enter your bloodstream. Examples include using intravenous (IV) drugs and having a catheter or another medical device in your body for long periods.
Other factors make it more likely that germs will attach to and infect your heart. Examples include having:
An abnormal or damaged heart valve
An artificial heart valve
Congenital heart defects (defects that are present at birth)
Damage to the inner lining of the heart due to rheumatic fever
Heart valves damaged by rheumatic fever or calcium deposits that cause age-related valve thickening

Infective endocarditis (IE) is an infection of the inner lining of the heart chambers and valves, or the blood vessels that lead to or from the heart. The term “endocarditis” means inflammation of the inner layer of the heart, and “infective” refers to the presence of a bacterial or fungal infection.
IE can be acute (rapid onset with severe symptoms) or subacute (slow onset with mild symptoms). Acute IE is a medical emergency and requires immediate treatment. Subacute IE can be more difficult to diagnose because the symptoms may be vague or develop slowly over time.
The bacteria or fungi that cause IE can enter the bloodstream through needles, syringes, or other medical devices that break the skin. They can also enter through cracks or sores in the skin. Once in the bloodstream, the bacteria or fungi can travel to the heart and infect the inner lining or valves.
People who have certain heart conditions, such as damaged or artificial valves, are at higher risk for IE. Other risk factors include intravenous drug use, unsterilized tattooing or body piercing, and recent surgery or dental work.
Symptoms of IE may include fever, chills, fatigue, aching muscles and joints, night sweats, shortness of breath, and fluid buildup in the arms or legs. The appearance of small, painless, red or purple spots on the skin, fingers, or toes may also be a symptom of IE.
Diagnosis of IE usually involves blood cultures to identify the bacteria or fungi causing the infection, as well as echocardiography to look for signs of infection in the heart.
Treatment for IE typically involves a combination of antibiotics and, in some cases, surgery to repair or replace damaged heart valves.

What Causes Infective Endocarditis?
IE is caused by bacteria or fungi that enter the bloodstream and attach to abnormal heart valves or other areas of the heart. Several factors increase the risk of developing IE, including:
Damaged or artificial heart valves
Congenital heart defects
Intravenous drug use, especially if needles are shared or reused
Implanted medical devices in the heart or blood vessels
Poor dental hygiene and untreated dental infections
Recent surgery or other invasive procedure
Immunosuppression (reduced ability of the immune system to fight infections)
Some people have a higher risk of developing IE than others. People at increased risk should take antibiotics before certain dental or medical procedures to reduce the risk of infection. Your doctor can tell you if you are at increased risk for IE.
What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Infective Endocarditis?
The signs and symptoms of IE vary from person to person. They also can vary over time in the same person. Signs and symptoms may include:
Flu-like symptoms, such as fever, chills, fatigue (tiredness), aching muscles, and headaches
Shortness of breath or a cough that won’rangle go away
A new or changed heart murmur
Skin changes such as:
– Overall paleness.
– Small, painful, red or purplish bumps under the skin on the fingers or toes.
– Small, dark, painless flat spots on the palms of the hands or the soles of the feet.
