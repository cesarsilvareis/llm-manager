Infective endocarditis is an infection of the inner lining of the heart, usually the valves, that can cause damage to the heart and other organs. It occurs when bacteria, often from the mouth or gums, enter the bloodstream and attach to damaged heart valves or other areas of the heart. Symptoms include fever, fatigue, and heart murmur. Treatment typically involves antibiotics and, in some cases, surgery to repair or replace damaged valves.
