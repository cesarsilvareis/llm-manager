- The heart is a pump that pushes blood through the body. It has four chambers, two on top and two on bottom. Blood enters the right side of the heart from the body and is pumped to the lungs where it gets oxygen. Then the blood returns to the left side of the heart and is pumped out to the rest of the body. - Bacteria are tiny organisms that can cause infection. They live all around us and inside our bodies. Most bacteria do not make us sick. However, some bacteria can cause infections. These bacteria can get into the bloodstream and travel to the heart. When they reach the heart, they can attach to the valves or other parts of the heart and grow there. This causes an infection called infective endocarditis (IE). - IE can be very serious because it damages the heart. If the infection is not treated, it can lead to death. - People who have certain types of heart disease are at higher risk for getting IE. This includes people with artificial heart valves, congenital heart defects, and rheumatic heart disease. - There are several ways to prevent IE. One way is to take antibiotics before dental procedures or surgeries that could put bacteria into the bloodstream. Another way is to practice good hygiene, such as washing your hands regularly and avoiding contact with people who are sick. - If you think you may have IE, it is important to see a doctor right away. Early diagnosis and treatment are essential for preventing serious complications.

## Explanation of infective endocarditits for medical students:
- The heart is a muscular organ that pumps blood throughout the body. It consists of four chambers: two atria and two ventricles. The atria receive blood from the veins and pump it into the ventricles, which then pump it out to the arteries. - Bacteria are microscopic organisms that can cause infection. They are found everywhere in the environment and can enter the body through breaks in the skin, mucous membranes, or surgical wounds. Once inside the body, bacteria can multiply rapidly and spread to other tissues. - Infective end
