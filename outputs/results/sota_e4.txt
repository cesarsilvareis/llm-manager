 Infective Endocarditis (IE) is an infection of the inner lining of the heart (endocardium) and heart valves. It typically occurs when bacteria or other microorganisms enter the bloodstream and attach to damaged heart valves or other areas of the heart. IE can cause a range of symptoms, including fever, fatigue, and heart murmur, and can lead to serious complications such as heart failure or sepsis. Treatment usually involves a combination of antibiotics and, in some cases, surgery to repair or replace damaged heart valves.

 Infective Endocarditis (IE) is an infection of the inner lining of the heart (endocardium) and heart valves, caused by bacteria, fungi, or other microorganisms. It can develop when these microorganisms enter the bloodstream and attach to damaged heart valves or other areas of the heart. IE can cause symptoms such as fever, fatigue, and heart murmur. It can be a serious and potentially life-threatening condition if not treated promptly.

 Infective Endocarditis (IE) is an infection of the inner lining of the heart (endocardium) and heart valves, often caused by bacteria entering the bloodstream. It can lead to serious complications such as heart failure, stroke, and sepsis. IE typically occurs in individuals with pre-existing heart conditions, but can also result from intravenous drug use or other factors. Treatment usually involves prolonged antibiotic therapy and, in some cases, surgical intervention.
