 life-threatening infection of the endocardial surface of the heart. The incidence of IE has been increasing over the past decade, with an estimated 15,000 new cases per year in the United States. IE is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, with a 30-day mortality rate of 10-20% and a 1-year mortality rate of 30-50%. Early diagnosis and prompt initiation of appropriate antimicrobial therapy are critical for improving outcomes in patients with IE. However, the diagnosis of IE can be challenging due to its nonspecific clinical presentation and the need for invasive procedures such as transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) to confirm the diagnosis. In this case report, we present a case of IE in a patient with a history of intravenous drug use (IVDU). The patient presented with fever, chills, and shortness of breath and was found to have a positive blood culture for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA).
