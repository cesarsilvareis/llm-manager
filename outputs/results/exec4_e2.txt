Infective endocarditis is an infectious disease caused by bacteria or fungi that affects the inner lining of the heart valves. It can lead to serious complications such as heart failure, stroke, and even death if left untreated. Diagnosis involves blood cultures, echocardiography, and other imaging tests. Treatment typically involves antibiotics and sometimes surgery to repair damaged valves. Proper prevention measures include good dental hygiene and avoiding invasive procedures when possible.
