 serious disease with high morbidity and mortality. The diagnosis of IE is based on the modified Duke criteria, which include clinical, microbiological, and echocardiographic findings. Echocardiography plays an important role in the diagnosis of IE. However, there are no specific echocardiographic features for IE. Therefore, it is essential to know the most common echocardiographic findings in patients with IE. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted from January 2017 to December 2018 at the Cardiology Department of the University Hospital of Alexandria, Egypt. All patients who were admitted with suspected IE were included in this study. Patients with prosthetic valves or cardiac devices were excluded. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) was performed for all patients within 48 hours after admission. Results: A total of 65 patients were enrolled in this study. The mean age was 39.5 years, and 61.5% were males. The most common predisposing factor was rheumatic heart disease (RHD), followed by intravenous drug abuse (IVDA). Vegetations were detected in 81.5% of cases. The mitral valve was the most commonly affected valve (41.5%). The most common echocardiographic finding was vegetation (81.5%), followed by periannular complications (PACs) (43.1%) and valvular regurgitation (38.5%). PACs were more common in native valve endocarditis (NVE) than in prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE) (45.5% vs. 16.7%, p = 0.04). Conclusion: RHD is still the main predisposing factor for IE in our country. The most common echocardiographic findings in patients with IE are vegetations, PACs, and valvular regurgitation.

# Introduction
Infective endocarditis (IE) is a serious disease that affects the endothelial lining of the heart, especially the valves. It can also involve the mural end
